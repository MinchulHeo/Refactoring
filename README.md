# Refactoring


History of my Refactoring
I read "Refactoring of Martin Fowler" in 2021, which was very interesting and could learn a new world.
After studying Refactoring, I wanted to record how to reshape the code. 

Maybe Martin Fowler will visit here....

The reason I write in English as a Korean is because I have the expectation that English will increase even a little when I do this.

Well... I don't know. My language skills are not enough to explain the process of refactoring in English.

After all, I think I will comment in Korean someday...
